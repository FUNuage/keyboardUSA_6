This is a bit TRICKY - we Want/almost NEED names for Personalization and sentence constructions.
Also for Puzzle Statements like:

BOB, KATHY, TOM, AND JUDY EACH HAVE ONE PET.
THEIR PETS ARE A DOG, A CAT, A GIRBEL, AND A CANARY.

CLUES:

	TOM'S PET LIVES IN A CAGE
	THE BOY WHO OWNS THE DOG GOES TO SCHOOL WITH THE GIRL THE OWNS THE CAT
	KATHY'S PET IS A GREAT SINGER
